In just 3 years from 2007 to 2010 city hospitals surounding changed unrecognisably. The biggest transformation occured in the parking solutions, where the public and staff car park were sepereated from each other to different locations now. What were the conciquences of this change?

Before the reconstruction occured, there were trees around the Hospital Rd. and from its east side was the shared car park. With this layout all of the traffic needed go through the Ring Road around the city hospital building. It was then decided to split this shared car park and relocated it somewhere else. The staff car park stayed in the same place, but with more space for the workers. On the other hand for the public one was a new car space created from the east side of the hospital building.

To further improve the transportation to the hospital, a bus station was sugested on the west side of the Hospital Rd. Additionally two roundaround were introduced to connect the Hospital Rd. with the bus station.

With the introduction of seperating of the shared car park the transportation to the hospital more complex, but with the benefit of reducing the load on a single road.
